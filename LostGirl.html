   <h1> <i> Lost Girl </i> </h1>
   <p> <i> There was once a little girl. Her name was 樂霞. Meaning Lexia. They lived in China. She lived with her kind mother and her grandmother who always baked her cookies after school. Her mother's name is 露西. Meaning Lucy. Her grandmother's name is 妮婭. Meaning Nia. 樂霞 (Lexia) would always come home to the smell of fresh cookies out of the oven. Her grandmother,      妮婭 (Nia) loves to cook. So 樂霞 (Lexia) would always come home to a treat. 露西 (Lucy), would always come home to her mother on the couch reading a book or doing homework. 露西(Lucy) is 十(ten) years old. She is in 5th grade. She always gets good grades. That is why her grandmother cooks her treats. Now, I'll stop talking about nonsense!
