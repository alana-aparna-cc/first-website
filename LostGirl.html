   <h1> <i> Lost Girl </i> </h1>
   <p> <i> There was once a little girl. Her name was 樂霞. Meaning Lexia. They lived in China. She lived with her kind mother and her grandmother who always baked her cookies after school. Her mother's name is 露西. Meaning Lucy. Her grandmother's name is 妮婭. Meaning Nia. 樂霞 (Lexia) would always come home to the smell of fresh cookies out of the oven. Her grandmother, 妮婭 (Nia) loves to cook. So 樂霞 (Lexia) would always come home to a treat. 露西 (Lucy), would always come home to her mother on the couch reading a book or doing homework. 露西(Lucy) is 十(ten) years old. She is in 5th grade. She always gets good grades. That is why her grandmother cooks her treats. Now, I'll stop talking about nonsense! 露西 (Lucy) came home to nothing, one day. She was very confused. Her mom wasn't on the couch as usual. </p>
  <p> "你好？！ 有人在嗎？(Hello?! Is anybody there?" </p>
   <p> There was no response. A few minutes later she was tired of the quiet room. She decided to cook dinner for herself. She intendedd to only do that, but when she looked at the time, there was her answer why she was alone. There was no time. She realised that if there was no time then something was up. She pinched herself, expecting to feel the pinch. But she didn't feel anything. It was like she was all of a sudden in a coma! She was terrified. She went everywhere to see if there was anybody. There was nobody in the whole country! She knew by the first thing she saw. She went to her neighbors house and went right in. Expecting the dogs to tackle her, as usual, nobody, not even the dogs, was there! </p>
   "嗯 今天是奇怪的一天！(Hmmm. Taday is a queer day!)"
   <p> She then woke up to a clean white hospital bed. She was confused. She woke up to American people talking to her like they knew her all her life. She didn't understand a word they were saying. She tryed to talk in Chinese, but she spoke American. </p>
   <p> "Where am I? Ahhh!!! How am I talking English? I-I speak Chinese!" She screamed in fear </p>
   <p> "What do you mean Lexia?! You <i> our daughter </i>." </p>
   <p> She was confused at first, but then, she realised that she had just been in a coma for all her life. She somehow had a error and had a coma in China, which made her think she was born in China, raised and united in China, and spoke Chinese. She, then, explained to them that she was in a coma in China, for some odd reason. She also said that she needed English class; for she could speak in English, ut she couldn't understand it. And so, she took English class, and learned to understand it. She then was able to know everything that Americans knew. She loved to know that she was a normal. And so, now, she is a normal girl, living here in America. </p>
