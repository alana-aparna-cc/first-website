  <h1> The Timer </h1>
  <p> There was once a little girl named Elizabeth. Her father had died in a car crash. Her mother was missing. Her grandmother was the one who took care of her. Every day after school, Elizabeth would lie down in bed and stare at the cieling for hours. Of course, she always did her homework before she did that. Her grandmother's name was Lisa. Lisa was 79. Lisa wa very old. Though, she never gave up on taking care of her 13 year old granddaughter. Lisa always would be sleeping by the time Elizabeth got home. One day, when Elizabeth came home, she saw a timer on the dining table. She tried to touch it but there was an electric zap that stopped her from doing so. She was very confused. She looked on the couch and found her grandmother dead. The most detailed thing about it was that she had a plate beside her. As soon as Elizabeth saw the plate she realised that her grandmother had been poisened. She tried to remember who her grandmother said would come over that day. She remebered only one person. For only one person visited that day. She then got the name. Angelica. Angelica was the name of her aunt. She was in shock. She couldn't believe that her aunt would do such a thing. But just as she went upstairs, she saw Aunt Angelica's dead body in the loft. One of the main details. She had a knife through her chest. She remembered that the neighbors always randomly come over. She then knew it was the neighbors. </p>
  <p> Now, the neighbors were only 5 & 6. So, she was confused why <i>they</i> would do it. Then she remembered <b>their parents<b>. Now, their parents always seemed suspicious. They would always go out to dinner, but come back with <b>different clothes<b>
