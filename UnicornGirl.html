<h1> The Unicorn </h1>
<p> This is one of my stories. Some of my stories may be a bit wierd. But I promise there was a lot of hard work done on all of these stories. </p> 
<p> Now Let's go!!! </p>
<p> Every story starts with, 'Once upon a time'. But this one starts with, 'Era uma vez'. In this universe, everybody speaks portugease and they are all animals. Kind of like a spirit animal world. Except, they don't represent anybody because everybody in that realm is half human and half animal. You will usually get your animal self when you are around 11. But if you get it around 14 or 13 you are counted as a late spirit. Everybody's talking <b> will </b> be in portugease, but it will <b> also </b> be translated. We start in ani-tropolis. A mixture of animal and tropolis. We come to meet Lia. But her family calls her リトルジェイラ Japanesse for Little Jayla. Jayla is her actually name but her middle names is Lia and that's what she perfures. She starts to wake up to te sound of her grandma yelling, "Desça Meu pequeno pêssego! (Come down my little peach!)" She responded, "Chegando! Eu só vou sair do meu pijama primeiro! (Coming! Just let me get out of my pajamas!" SHe starts to change so fast, you could hardly see she was changing. She wa downstairs in 1 second! And usually, that's an expression. But this time, it's not. When she heard her grandma say, "Você dormiu com suas roupas! Você foi tão rápido! (You slept with your clothes on! You went so fast!)" Then, she thought her animal was going to be a very speedy animal.
