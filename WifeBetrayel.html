    <h1> The Betrayel of a Wife </h1>
    <p> There was once a little girl, named Elisa. She had a crush on a boy named Andrew. She never knew that he would be the reason why she dies. Anyways, she decided to confess her love to him. He said that he loved her too, but he didn't. They grew up together. In High School they started dating. And, in college, Andrew proposed to Elisa. She, obviously, said yes. And, when they graduated, they got married. Elisa got cold feet and she said that she couldn't marry Andrew. She didn't know that Andrew had put a bomb on the bouqet. So, she died, and he, well, he went on to the next girl. But the last words he said to her, was, </p>
     <p> 'I'm sorry... I was paid to kill you...' </p>
      <p> And, of course, he said that to her dead body. He went on to the next wife. He got to know her, and he decided, after a while of getting to know her, he proposed. That girl was Nodia. Nodia said yes. Like Elisa. Andrew did not know that Nodia was controlled by Elisa. Andrew did not know that he could not kill Nodia. He thought that she was jut like every other human being. He didn't know that couldn't die.
