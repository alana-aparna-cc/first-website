<h1> <i>(One of my stories) The Haunted Closet</h1>
<p>There was once a single mother who raised her daughter peacfully, until one day. Allisa was just getting ready for school that started at 8 a.m. She got her outfit out of the closet, which, of course, was perfectly fine of those few moments. She then attempts to change for school, when she feels cold dead hands grab her arm. She is terrified, so, she decides to scream and kick for her mom to save her. What she didn't know was that the unkown monster had put a sleep spell on her Mother, Lisa.</p>
<p>Lisa then wakes up, and starts to scream for Allisa to get ready for school, little did she know she wasn't even in that particular building. She then checks Allisa's room and all she sees is a big stain of endless blood. She starts sobbing and couldn't believe that she let herself have her daughter be murdered with her in the building. She started to date and she then had two mor kids, Lia and Alissa II. She is very happy and <b> thinks </b> that they will be safe <b> forever</b>.
<p> I am pretty sure nobody is <b> currently </b> safe. And another thing, there's no such thing as being safe. Unless you are hidden. The yes, you are safe. But, one day, she sees that Allisa II has gone missing! She puts up wanted posters all over the city. She tries so hard to find her. Lia looked throught the family history book and had seen that Allisa II wasn't the first Allisa in the family. She notices that the two are basically conected. </p>
